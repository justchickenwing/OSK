# Firefox On Screen Keyboard (FX-OSK)
Fork from this Repository by TravFitz: [OSK Keyboard](https://github.com/TravFitz/Firefox-On-Screen-Keyboard)  

# Changes
- The keyboard is now anchored to the bottom of the window for better accessibility.
- Fixed the malfunctioning 'Enter' key by implementing a hard-coded "\n" function.
- Corrected the non-functional 'Tab' key by implementing a hard-coded "    " tabulation.
- Resolved the issue where characters were appended at the end of the text value; now, they are inserted at the cursor position.
- Applied styling enhancements for a more visually appealing interface.
